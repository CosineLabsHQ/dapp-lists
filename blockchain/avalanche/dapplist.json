The endpoint then notifies the UA specified Oracle and Relayer of the message and it's destination chain.

Playing on a board is fun, but you can also play mini games to get advantage of your opponents, complete quests to get resources, interact with your pet, boost your character, and many other things. Once in every few weeks, a new seasonal event is released, bringing new story, board, characters, pets, items, quests and other stuff.\n\nPixudi combines 2 business models: Free2Play and Play2Collect. It means that players don't need to pay any money to start playing but they can purchase Mystery Packs to enhance their gaming experience: get nicer characters and boost them, receive items, etc. Important note: there is no Pay-to-Win mechanics in Pixudi. No matter how many Mystery Packs you buy, victory is not guaranteed. All characters and items can be sold on a marketplace.\n\n",

In doing so, Entangle achieves capital efficiency for users whilst incentivizing sticky liquidity for protocols. \nSupporting the Entangle dApps is a Custom Oracle Infrastructure validated on an Oracle-Centric Blockchain (DPoS Cosmos-SDK EVM Compatible) using the Tendermint algorithm to achieve consensus amongst Validators.\nThe Oracle solution can be also utilised by external dApps, offering competitive advantages such as usability on any chain, cost optimization through customization of parameters and possibilities of complex information processing.",

For traders, it not only reduces the cross-chain transaction loss to 0, but also breaks through the limitation of liquidity pools. For the protocol, it not only reduces the security risk of cross-chain assets, but also greatly improves the utilization rate of funds. In addition to bridging USDC on different chains, it will also directly aggregate as many DEXs as possible to give users the optimal route, allowing users to have more asset choices on the source chain and the target chain (for example: allowing users to swap $ETH on Ethereum for $ARB on Arbitrum).",
