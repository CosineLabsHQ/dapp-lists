The endpoint then notifies the UA specified Oracle and Relayer of the message and it's destination chain. The Oracle forwards the block header to the endpoint on chain B and the Relayer then submits the transaction proof.\n\nThe proof is validated on the destination chain and the message is forwarded to the destination address.",
