In doing so, Entangle achieves capital efficiency for users whilst incentivizing sticky liquidity for protocols. \nSupporting the Entangle dApps is a Custom Oracle Infrastructure validated on an Oracle-Centric Blockchain (DPoS Cosmos-SDK EVM Compatible) using the Tendermint algorithm to achieve consensus amongst Validators.\nThe Oracle solution can be also utilised by external dApps, offering competitive advantages such as usability on any chain, cost optimization through customization of parameters and possibilities of complex information processing.",

For traders, it not only reduces the cross-chain transaction loss to 0, but also breaks through the limitation of liquidity pools. For the protocol, it not only reduces the security risk of cross-chain assets, but also greatly improves the utilization rate of funds. In addition to bridging USDC on different chains, it will also directly aggregate as many DEXs as possible to give users the optimal route, allowing users to have more asset choices on the source chain and the target chain (for example: allowing users to swap $ETH on Ethereum for $ARB on Arbitrum).",
