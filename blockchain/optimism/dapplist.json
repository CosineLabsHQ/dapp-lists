Bug bounty programs enable developers to uncover vulnerabilities in their applications by rewarding hackers who identify them. These programs are prevalent in the Web2 space, where they often lack any form of payment guarantee for whitehats, allowing developers to sometimes underpay or refuse payment. Bug Buster operates within a deterministic RISC-V machine that boots Linux and accepts applications in any major programming language. Through a user-friendly web interface, anyone can submit and sponsor applications with ETH to incentivize hackers. All major wallets are supported. Hackers can test their exploits directly in the browser without needing to sign Web3 transactions. When a hacker discovers a valid exploit, they can initiate a transaction to transfer the reward to their account. Bug Buster does not require a specific format for the exploit; it can be in any language suitable for the application, such as Lua for a Lua library or SQL for the SQLite database engine. If no valid exploits are submitted by a specified deadline, sponsors may request a refund. Get ready to use Bug Buster, powered by Cartesi, for a much-needed guarantee of fairness in bug bounty programs!",

Supra, as a vertically integrated IntraLayer, enables a shared security paradigm across a variety of oracle services. This includes securing external data on-chain, cross-chain consensus via their bridgeless HyperNova, automation, VRF, and more.\n\nAfter thousands of hours of R&D and simulations, Supra‚Äôs technical breakthroughs are solving the Oracle Dilemma and optimizing network performance across the board in terms of security, throughput, time to finality, composability, and programmability. Supra has taken an academic approach to development, which has been an integral part of the organization‚Äôs commitment to advancing Web3 performance and security. This is characterized by a commitment to deep research, transparency, and going through a rigorous peer-review process in every design and product released.\n\nLed by Dr. Aniket Kate, famous for inventing KZK Polynomial Commitments, Supra‚Äôs protocols have been accepted to top academic journals, placing it as the state-of-the-art for Oracle Protocols as well as their VRF (Verifiable Random Function services).\n\nSupraOracles price feeds are live on 40+ blockchains. Supra is publishing 1.2M data points on Sui every day.",

In doing so, Entangle achieves capital efficiency for users whilst incentivizing sticky liquidity for protocols. \nSupporting the Entangle dApps is a Custom Oracle Infrastructure validated on an Oracle-Centric Blockchain (DPoS Cosmos-SDK EVM Compatible) using the Tendermint algorithm to achieve consensus amongst Validators.\nThe Oracle solution can be also utilised by external dApps, offering competitive advantages such as usability on any chain, cost optimization through customization of parameters and possibilities of complex information processing.",

These yields are auto-compounded and paid out when the order is executed. This makes the protocol more capital efficient than existing exchanges. Imagine Yield farming + trading combined into one like notes combining to make a melodious symphony. üéµ\nLimit & Stoploss orders are currently available. The limit order lets you maximize profits by timing top. While the Stoploss orders are essential for hedging the volatility risk of crypto assets. Stoploss orders can also be used to buy the dip.\nLiquidity is aggregated across the network with the help of DEX aggregators like Paraswap ‚ù§Ô∏è How does that help? Trades are executed at the best price with tight slippage. This also means that the orders are filled as soon as the price hits the set limit or stoploss.",

For traders, it not only reduces the cross-chain transaction loss to 0, but also breaks through the limitation of liquidity pools. For the protocol, it not only reduces the security risk of cross-chain assets, but also greatly improves the utilization rate of funds. In addition to bridging USDC on different chains, it will also directly aggregate as many DEXs as possible to give users the optimal route, allowing users to have more asset choices on the source chain and the target chain (for example: allowing users to swap $ETH on Ethereum for $ARB on Arbitrum).",
